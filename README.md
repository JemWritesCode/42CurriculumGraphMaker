# 42CurriculumGraphMaker
Update the curriculum graph more easily. (AKA Holy Graph / Curriculum Galaxy)
Currently you can use this to click on the graph and add the text. This will give you a list of coordinates you can enter in Intra.

You can use the graph maker here: https://editor.p5js.org/kaidrumm/sketches/-Xb87w9b8

### Currently in Development:
#### Goal#1: File > Save Graph
  
  Will save into a .txt file
  
#### Goal#2: File > Upload Graph
  
  You can upload the .txt file so you don't have to start from scratch every time.
  
#### Goal#3: Connections: 
  
  Draw the connections between nodes and get the coordinates. This will correlate to the "By" of Project Data in the 42API.

#### Goal#4: File > Upload to 42Intra
  
  Call the 42API to upload the new graph to the intra.
  
 -----
 #### Goal#5: Node Size
  Change the size of the shape.
  
 #### Goal#6: Additional Shapes
   Rectangles, Diamonds, Triangles, etc
  
#### Goal#7: Multi-Select
  Hold down Ctrl and select multiple nodes/connections so you can move entire sections at a time. This will be useful for updating entire branches. 
 
 #### Goal#8: Box Select / Magic Wand Select
  Select all nodes inside of a box.  It may be a good idea to also allow drawing a selection for better targeting.
