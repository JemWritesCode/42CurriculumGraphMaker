# 42CurriculumGraphMaker
Update the curriculum graph more easily. (AKA Holy Graph / Curriculum Galaxy)
Currently you can use this to click on the graph and add the text. This will give you a list of coordinates you can enter in Intra.

You can use the graph maker here: https://editor.p5js.org/kaidrumm/sketches/-Xb87w9b8

### Currently in Development:
Goal#1: File > Save Graph
  Will save into a .txt file
  
Goal#2: File > Upload Graph
  You can upload the .txt file so you don't have to start from scratch every time.
  
Goal#3: Connections: 
  Draw the connections between nodes and get the coordinates. This will correlate to the "By" of Project Data in the 42API.

Goal#4: File > Upload to 42Intra
  Call the 42API to upload the new graph to the intra.
